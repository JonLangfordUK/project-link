# Project Link

An open source solution to source file management in game development.

Having worked on multiple AAA games, I have found that working with source files to be problematic with files being saved to desktop and never submitted to source control. This problem is only exasperated when working with multiple outsource vendors.

Project Link hopes to be a solution to make this process easier. In a nutshell, it aims to be a layer between source control and developers authoring tools. It will manage the naming, tagging, relationships of assets as well as provide a platform for review.

## The why

There are existing paid solutions available for this purpose, but they are only financially viable for large studios, and not for a small indie developer.
